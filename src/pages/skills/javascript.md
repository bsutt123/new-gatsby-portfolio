# JavaScript

I've had the opportunity to use JavaScript (JS) in nearly all of my projects. I feel very comfortable in all the different parts of the language, and I really love to get down into the guts of the language and get a chance to learn more about what it is actually happening in the language.

## Skill Level

I would call myself an advanced JS user. I have written a lot of JS as a start, but more importantly I have made it my goal to not just understand how to write JS but also _why_ it functions the way it does. Its one thing to understand how to use the tools that JS provides like closure, and the new class syntax, but I think that its an entirely different point to be able to articulate what each of those tools is actually doing. I think that understanding the fundamentals of the language, and being able to recognize things like closure, prototypal inheritance and lexical scope help me write cleaner, better, and less buggy code. 

## Projects using Javascript

* [Discovr]
* [Vue-Chat]
* [Its So Ranunculus]
* [Web Portfolio]
* [All Chatty Versions]
* [Bloc-Jams]

## Courses and Learning

I of course got the chance to do tons of JS practice while I was attending Bloc, but any web developer knows that its impossible for any one source to provide you all the information you need to become a master. Recently, I've started to work on taking courses from Udemy and Frontend Masters in order to expand my JS knowledge, and I have completed these so far in addition to all the projects that I have completed.

## What I love about the Language

There is a lot to love about JS, but I think that the most interesting thing to me is the way that JS has implemented both static and dynamic scoping within the same language. It's incredibly powerful to be able to leverage the advantages of lexical scoping, giving functions a static environment to determine variables, as well as being about to use `this** to refer to objects dynamically referenced by the functions scope. I find it hard to imagine what it would be like to have to program without either of these incredibly powerful features.

The way that JS treats functions as first class objects is another one of my favorite parts about the language. Not only is it important for dealing with event listeners and callbacks, its essential for a language if you want to implement functional programming principals t

## What frustrates me about JavaScript

My biggest frustration with JS is the lack of standard library tools that you might find in a more robust language. I also have had the opportunity to use the ruby language in Rails for a number of different projects, and the way that ruby has generated such a robust standard library makes programming in ruby a real joy. I understand the need to keep a language lean, especially one that has to run in the browser, but I still wish there was a larger standard library.

## What I want to do next

With the way that the JS community and ecosystem is evolving, there is not limit to what you can do to grow into the language.
